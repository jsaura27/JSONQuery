This program for the translation of JSON Objects to MySQL queries uses the json.simple library for the easy management of the JSON file.

To use this program you just need to run the main method.
It will ask for an input file, if the file it's empty it will tell you and you should run it again.
If the file is not empty it will ask for an output file. 
If there is no output file inputed it will show everything on the command line.
If there is, it will fill that file with all the queries. 

There is a JUnit tester inside the program for testing.
